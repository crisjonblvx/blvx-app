# BLVX Branding (via Bonita)

## The Name
**B.L.V.X.** = Belonging. Language. Vibes. Exchange.

## Tagline / About
> "BLVX isn't about who you are on paper. It's about how you show up, how you speak, and how you connect."

## In-App Explanation
> "This is a belonging space first. The language is real. The vibes are intentional. And everything here is an exchange — not a performance."

## Founder Energy
Real talk. No performance. Connection over clout.
